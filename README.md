*   **Local Processing:** Prioritizes local data processing where possible. üè†
*   **Persona Identification:** Helps identify your username within different data sources for accurate persona generation. üë§
*   **FAQ Page:** Provides guidance on exporting data from supported platforms. ‚ùì

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

Follow these steps to set up the MindBack project locally.

**Prerequisites:**

*   [Git](https://git-scm.com/) üêô
*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm) üü©
*   [Python](https://www.python.org/) (version 3.x recommended) and pip üêç

**Steps:**

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd mindback # Or your repository folder name
    ```

2.  **Set up Frontend:**
    *   Navigate to the main project directory (e.g., `my-app` if that's the root containing `package.json`):
        ```bash
        # Make sure you are in the root project directory (e.g., my-app)
        npm install
        ```

3.  **Set up Backend:**
    *   Navigate to the backend directory:
        ```bash
        cd backend
        ```
    *   **Create and activate a Python virtual environment (Recommended):**
        *   On macOS/Linux:
            ```bash
            python3 -m venv venv
            source venv/bin/activate
            ```
        *   On Windows:
            ```bash
            python -m venv venv
            .\venv\Scripts\activate
            ```
    *   **Install Python dependencies:**
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
    *   **Set up Environment Variables:** üîë
        *   Create a file named `.env` inside the `backend` directory.
        *   Add your Google Gemini API key to the `.env` file:
            ```env
            GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE
            # Optional: Adjust AI temperature (0.1 to 1.0, default 0.5)
            # GHOSTTEXT_TEMPERATURE=0.7
            ```
        *   Replace `YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual API key. You can obtain one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Application

**Prerequisite:** Ensure you have created the `.env` file inside the `backend` directory and added your `GEMINI_API_KEY` as described in the Installation steps above. The application will not function correctly without it. ‚ùó

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    *   Make sure you are in the `backend` directory and your virtual environment is activated (if you created one).
    *   Run the Flask API:
        ```bash
        python api.py
        ```
    *   The backend server should start, typically on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

2.  **Start the Frontend Development Server:**
    *   Open a **new terminal** or navigate back to the root project directory (e.g., `my-app`).
    *   Run the Vite development server:
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```
    *   The frontend server should start, typically on `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is busy).

3.  **Access the Application:**
    *   Open your web browser and navigate to the URL provided by the Vite development server (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`). üåê

## ü§î How to Use

1.  **Upload Data:** Click the "Uploaded Data" button in the sidebar to open the upload modal. Drag and drop your `.zip` data archives or browse to select them. Click "Save Changes".
2.  **Process Data:** The application will automatically process the uploaded data after you save changes in the upload modal. Wait for the processing to complete.
3.  **Select Year/Persona:** Once processing is done, available years will appear. Click on a year in the sidebar (or use the dropdown in an existing tab) to start a conversation. You will be prompted to identify your username within the data sources for that year to create the persona.
4.  **Chat:** Interact with the AI persona representing the selected year. Use the input field at the bottom to ask questions or chat. üí¨
5.  **Manage Tabs:** Add new tabs (+) to chat with different years simultaneously, switch between tabs, or close tabs (x).

## üíª Technology Stack

*   **Frontend:** React, Vite, Framer Motion, CSS
*   **Backend:** Flask (Python), Google Gemini API
*   **Data Processing:** Python standard libraries (zipfile, json, re, etc.), BeautifulSoup
